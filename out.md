  Learn to Turn! Someone will show you how to turn wood safely on a lathe & which tools you should use. You can turn spindles, pens, bowls, or a wide variety of other items. Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.  
The open house is generally unstructured. It has been more effective to work with people 1 on 1. That way people can start, and continue, learning at their own pace.

  Want to learn basic electronics? Interested in working with a microcontroller, like the arduino, ESP32, or the Raspberry Pi Pico? Need help designing your own PCB? Want to learn to program in Python? Or do you just want to find out more about the Makerspace (and take a tour)? All you have to do is stop by the open house and ask, and someone will be happy to work with you.

Build a shelf? Build a bird or bat house? Work on these projects and anything you imagine every week!

Drop in a take a tour of the Makerspace to see what it's all about.

  Free and open to the public, kids and adults! This is the time to come and develop your creative skills among friends. We've got tools and volunteers to help with all kinds of arts and crafts. Here are a few to get you thinking about what you'd like to try:

-   Pottery - Hand built, Slab rolling, or Wheel thrown
-   Sewing - Embroidery, Serger, Quilting
-   Painting - Acrylic, Water color, Oil
-   Card Making
-   Jewelry
-   Origami
-   Yarn - Knit or Crochet

Bring in a project you're working on or an idea of what you'd like to try and we'll do what we can to help bring it to life.  
Lately, we've been spending most of the open house in the pottery studio and above are some of our creations.

  Join SpaceCoastSec at 6:30PM EST for an in-person gathering of local cybersecurity professionals, enthusiasts, and curious learners. Each meetup features a speaker discussing a timely infosec topic, as well as open discussion time before and after the presentation for casual banter and friendly networking. Our sessions are informal, inclusive, and completely free‚Äîno matter your experience level or background. Come learn, share ideas, ask questions, and stay updated on the latest trends in cybersecurity as part of Brevard County‚Äôs growing information security community.

Our monthly in-person meetups are held on the 2nd floor of Building 3 on the EFSC Palm Bay campus unless otherwise stated here on Meetup.

This month's presentation will be on locksport. Locksport is the hobby or sport of learning to open locks without the original key, often through techniques like lock picking. It encompasses the study of lock mechanisms and the ethical practice of defeating them, often involving competitive events and a community of enthusiasts.
